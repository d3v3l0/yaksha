# YAKSHA

__My personal automation daimons :: use at your own risk!__

The term [YAKSHA][yaksha], is used to refer to ["fairies", "demons" and "spirits"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaksha) in Sanskrit. This repo is my personal automation daimon for __*nix__ dev installation, updates, backups, bash scripts, dockerfiles, playbooks, dotfiles and configuration files. 

The push towards automation began with my need for a standard development environment across multiple machines. Manual customization was time-consuming and error-prone - a big time-sink resulting in discrepancies with machines that worked differently or worse, dependency-hell. 


For a long time I used shell scripts to manage the `apt-get` install process but these old bash scripts are being retired, slowly, for a new IT automation tool. ATM, I am in the process of porting to use `ansible`, an agentless distro-agnostic tool to manage my dev environments; which requires free-time, a short commodity. Hence, this repo will be a WIP sandbox for my experiments that may be unstable, break stuff, etc.. DONT USE on a production server. 

The standard disclaimer applies: Read the __License & Disclaimer__ No warranty and/or guarantee for any particular use, express or implied and you use these [automation daimons][yaksha] at your own risk and liability!

# INSTALLATION 

1. At the outset, your Ubuntu machine should have _Ansible and Git_ intalled.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ansible git
```

You can also use `pip` to install ansible but I prefer the apt package. Note that if you have a standalone machine this step is a manual process, else automated for the network install.

2. Now clone this repo and execute the scripts. For SSH, use the URL `git@github.com:svaksha/yaksha.git` via the clone command:

```
git clone ssh://github.com/svaksha/yaksha.git
```

Alternatively, Github offers HTTPS (replace the ssh with https in the above command) as transfer protocols or the repo can be downloaded as a [zip-file][download] (latest 'master' branch).

3. Then, to install all the Ubuntu packages, run the ansible playbooks inside the Ubuntu folder. 

```
ansible-playbook -b -K ubuntu/ansible-apt-ubuntu.yaml
ansible-playbook -b -K roles/ubuntu/main.yml

```

There is a lot of legacy code that needs to go (when I have the time :-)), but presently the structure has changed to:

* __/roles__: Splitting ansible playbooks for different tasks requires a [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) directory.
