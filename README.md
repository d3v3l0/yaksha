# YAKSHA
__My personal automation daimons, use at your own risk!__

The term [YAKSHA][yaksha], is used to refer to ["fairies", "demons" and "spirits"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaksha) in Sanskrit. This repo is my personal automation daimon for __*nix__ dev installation, updates, backups, bash scripts, dockerfiles, dotfiles and configuration files. 

The push towards automation began with my need for a standard development environment across multiple machines. Manual customization was time-consuming and error-prone - a big time-sink resulting in discrepancies with machines that worked differently or worse, dependency-hell. 

I am in the process of moving to the `ansible` IT automation tool which is an agent-less Env-agnostic tool that can manage all environments. I started using shell scripts but the older bash scripts are being retired, slowly. Porting things to `ansible` requires free-time, a short commodity. Hence, this repo will be a sandbox for my experiments that may be unstable, break stuff, etc.. DONT USE on a production server. 

The standard disclaimer applies: Read the __License & Disclaimer__ No warranty and/or guarantee for any particular use, express or implied and you use these [automation daimons][yaksha] at your own risk and liability!

# INSTALLATION 

1. At the outset, your Ubuntu machine should have _Ansible and Git_ intalled.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ansible git
```

You can also use `pip` to install ansible but I prefer the apt package. Note that if you have a standalone machine this step is a manual process, else automated for the network install.

2. Now clone this repo and execute the scripts. For SSH, use the URL `git@github.com:svaksha/yaksha.git` via the clone command:

```
git clone ssh://github.com/svaksha/yaksha.git
```

Alternatively, Github offers HTTPS (replace the ssh with https in the above command) as transfer protocols or the repo can be downloaded as a [zip-file][download] (latest 'master' branch).

3. Then, to install all the Ubuntu packages, run the ansible playbooks inside the Ubuntu folder. __NB:__ Note that `yaksha` is  not to be run on a production server.
