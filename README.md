# YAKSHA
__My personal automation daimons, use at your own risk!__

[YAKSHA][yaksha], meaning "demon" in Sanskrit, is my personal automation daimon (daemons, if you like) standardized for __*nix__ dev installation, updates, backups, bash scripts, dockerfiles, dotfiles and configuration files using the `ansible` IT automation tool which is an agent-less Env-agnostic tool that can manage all environments.

Configuring and setting up a new machine manually was time-consuming and error-prone to customize for multiple development environments - a time-sink resulting in discrepancies with machines that worked differently or worse, dependency-hell. 

I was using shell scripts but am porting it to ansible so this repo is a time permitting WIP, read, an experimental development state that may be unstable, break stuff and definitely not meant for production server use. 

The standard disclaimer applies: Read the __License & Disclaimer__ No warranty and/or guarantee for any particular use, express or implied and you use these [automation daimons][yaksha] at your own risk and liability!

# INSTALLATION 

1. At the outset, your Ubuntu machine should have _Ansible and Git_ intalled.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ansible git
```

You can also use `pip` to install ansible but I prefer the apt package. Note that if you have a standalone machine this step is a manual process, else automated for the network install.

2. Now clone this repo and execute the scripts. For SSH, use the URL `git@github.com:svaksha/yaksha.git` via the clone command:

```
git clone ssh://github.com/svaksha/yaksha.git
```

Alternatively, Github offers HTTPS (replace the ssh with https in the above command) as transfer protocols or the repo can be downloaded as a [zip-file][download] (latest 'master' branch).

3. Then, to install all the Ubuntu packages, run the ansible playbooks inside the Ubuntu folder. __NB:__ Note that `yaksha` is  not to be run on a production server.
